            <p class="paragraph-flexible">In 2015 I got admitted at dept. of CSE Begum Rokeya University Rangpur. At first semeseter I obtained just up the CGPA 3(3.04). At second semester I promoted my study and got CGPA 3.19. At third semester I obtained my best ever CGPA 3.45.Then story became horrible and I obtained CGPA 2.86 that was my worst ever. Then I tried to promot my CGPA and at 7th semester I obtained CGPA 3.18. I hope at the end of the honours I can pass with GPA >3.2.Keep me in your prayers. Thanks. But coudn't gain any skill on CSE field. That is not good. Because skill is the main </p>

            <h3>Become A Web Developer </h3>
            <p>One day while scrolling facebook I first time know about the session or online course of web-development by Jhankar Mahbub Vai. I noticed and read the full details about the course and was worried about the fees. But Alhamdulillah I could managed it and decided to run the course as I don't have any specifice CSE skills. Hope to become a full-stack web-developer one day In Sha Allah! </p>
